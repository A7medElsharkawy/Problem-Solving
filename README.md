# Problem-Solving

A structured collection of solutions to coding challenges from **LeetCode**, **CodeForces**, and other competitive programming platforms. Solutions are organized by topic and platform for easy navigation and review.

---

## Overview

This repository serves as a personal (or shared) problem-solving journal: each file contains a working solution with readable code. Where applicable, solutions include time and space complexity notes to support interview prep and algorithm study.

## Topics Covered

| Topic | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Array and Hashing** | Arrays, hash maps/sets, sliding window, subarrays |
| **LinkedList** | Singly/doubly linked lists, cycle detection, merging |
| **Stack** | Valid parentheses, stack-based parsing |
| **Trees** | Binary trees, BST, recursion, traversal |
| **graph** | Graph traversal, shortest path, connectivity |
| **heap** | Priority queue, top-k, frequency problems |
| **Math** | Integers, bits, number theory |
| **Two Pointers** | Sorted arrays, pairs, container problems |

## Conventions

- **File names**: LeetCode: number + title (e.g. `3. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters.py`). Other problems: title only (e.g. `Reverse Linked List.py`).
- **Solutions**: Implemented as classes (e.g. `Solution` with required method) where that matches the platform (e.g. LeetCode).
- **Complexity**: Time and space complexity are often noted in comments at the bottom of the file.

---

## Requirements

- **Python 3** (no extra dependencies required for the core solutions).

To run a solution, execute the file or call the solution class as needed (e.g. with sample inputs in a `if __name__ == "__main__":` block if added).

---

## Platforms

- **[LeetCode](https://leetcode.com)** — Most solutions are from LeetCode, grouped by pattern/topic.
- **[CodeForces](https://codeforces.com)** — Selected problems and contest rounds under `Python/CodeForces/` and `Contests/CodeForces/`.
